Once, a king and a lazy man named Haria were very good friends. At precisely 08:00 on 2018-10-30, the king said, 'Why don't you do work to earn some money?'


Haria said, 'No one gives me job at 9 in the morning. My enemies told everyone that I never do any work in time by 2019-9-10.'


The kind king said, 'You can go into my treasury and collect as much wealth as you can, till 21:03.'


Haria rushed home to tell this to his wife. She said, 'Go and get the gold coins and gems before 21:3.'


'I cannot go now. Give me lunch first at 12:15.'


After 13:100, he took a nap for until 13:15. Then in the late afternoon on 2018-11:30 at 16:30, he picked some bags and went to the palace. On the way, he felt hot so he sat under a tree to rest. Then, two hours later at 18:30, he got up to go but saw a man showing some magic tricks. He stopped to watch for an until 21:04.


When he reached the palace it was already after 21:03. The palace gates had been shut. So Haria had lost a golden chance because he had not learned the value of time on the 2018-13-01, a beautiful day.
